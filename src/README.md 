# Endowus Design Engineer Intern Assignment - Sungyong Lee

## 1. Introduction / Goal
This assignment demonstrates my technical skills in data visualization and design approach. The goal was to build a reusable, maintainable, and user-friendly solution for rendering interactive line charts.

## 2. Approach & Design Decisions
The project implemented an interactive line chart using React and Chart.js. My approach prioritized modularity and user experience (UX), guided by the following principles:

*   **Modular Architecture for Maintainability:**
    *   **`utils/formatUtils.js`:** Centralized highly reusable formatting utilities for numbers (K, M units) and dates.
    *   **`config/chartConfig.js`:** Encapsulated Chart.js configurations and data processing logic. Functions were designed for flexibility, accepting dynamic parameters for titles, labels, and currency symbols.
    *   **`InvestmentChartContainer.jsx`:** A dedicated component encapsulates all chart-related logic (loading, processing, and rendering), ensuring a clear separation of concerns from `App.jsx`.
*   **User-Centric Data Visualization:**
    *   Enhanced readability by automatically converting large monetary values to K/M units on tooltips and Y-axis labels.
    *   Formatted X-axis labels to 'Mon YYYY' for intuitive time series understanding.
    *   Integrated `chartjs-plugin-crosshair` to facilitate precise comparison of data points across multiple lines.

## 3. Key Features / Deliverables
*   Interactive line chart visualizing `investment.json` data.
*   Automated K/M unit conversion for tooltips and Y-axis monetary values.
*   'Mon YYYY' formatted date labels on the X-axis.
*   Data comparison functionality via `chartjs-plugin-crosshair`.
*   Modular code architecture focused on reusability, maintainability, and scalability.
*   **GitHub Repository:** [Your GitHub Repository Link Here] *(This is a good place to put it for quick reference)*

## 4. How to Run
Here's how to run the project:

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (`v20.19.2` version used)
*   npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

### Installation
1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository Link]
    cd [Your-Project-Folder-Name]
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

### Running the Project
1.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or yarn start
    ```
2.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` (or the specified port).

## 6. Challenges & Learnings
*   **`chartjs-plugin-crosshair` Integration:** Encountered a timing error during integration with Chart.js v4. I resolved this by implementing a `CustomCrosshairPlugin` that safely wraps the original `afterDraw` method, ensuring stability.
*   **Refactoring for Reusability:** Learned the importance of abstracting data processing (`processInvestmentChartData`) and formatting (`formatUtils.js`) logic to enhance modularity. This led to a cleaner and more adaptable codebase.
*   **Component Encapsulation:** Practiced effective component responsibility distribution by encapsulating all investment chart-specific logic within an `InvestmentChartContainer`, preventing the main `App.jsx` from becoming overly complex.

## 7. Future Improvements
*   **Theme Toggle:** Implement dark/light mode for a personalized user experience.
*   **Data Filtering/Range Selection:** Add functionality for users to filter data periods or select specific datasets.
*   **Accessibility Enhancements:** Improve chart accessibility with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
